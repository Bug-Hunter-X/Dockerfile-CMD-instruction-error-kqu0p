This repository contains a Dockerfile with a common error and its solution. The error arises from an incorrect use of the CMD instruction in the Dockerfile.  The original Dockerfile attempts to directly run a Python script using the CMD instruction, which is incorrect. The solution demonstrates the correct way to execute a Python script within a Docker container by making it executable and correctly referencing it within the CMD instruction. This example highlights the importance of understanding how Docker executes commands and the correct way to handle script execution.
